    <p>In this stunning new
        book, <u><em><strong>"Outliers"</strong></em></u>--the
        best
        and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes
        high-achievers different?

        His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little
        attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the
        idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software
        billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made
        the Beatles the greatest rock band.
        <u><em><strong>Malcolm Gladwell
